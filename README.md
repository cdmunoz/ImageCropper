# ImageCropper
This project allows to apply a Cropper to an image. The image could be selected from local gallery, or taking a photo with the camera. 
It runs in Android N, taking into account the update with File providers. Also, the architecture could be improved, even the logic to extract part of the logic in a thread out the main UI for some features. But it was focused mainly in the feature of crop. It allows dragging, pinch and zoom as well. 
Some code were taken from other existent resources, referenced in the code.
